## 7effects.py

This sketch contains 7 effects or functions for illuminating LEDS.
The code is driven using **GPIO.BCM** library from the Raspberry Pi.
If you need to use the physical pin numberings try using **GPIO.BOARD** library instead of GPIO.BCM.

Here, LEDs are connected from **GPIO 2 to 9**
You can make the necessary changes in the code to suit your needs.

_Thank you :)_
